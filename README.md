# README
For this project, I created a dashbaord based on the website Netflix.
I chose Netflix as my inspiration for my dashbaord as when I was thinking of something to create I realized that I always go to netflix when im bored so I chose it.

# Functionality
The functionality of this webpage allows a user to navigate through the dashaord and view the different catagories.
A user can either scroll through the page to get to a specific catagory or can click on the tabs at the top right of the page to navigate.
Furthermore, a user can also use there scroll-wheel to scroll horizontally on different catagories.
